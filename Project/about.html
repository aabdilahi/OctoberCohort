<b>What is Luxury Holidays?</b>
<br>
<br>
We are the experts in bespoke luxury holidays. Luxury is personal to each and every one of our guests, which is why we have always truly tailored our holidays. 
Since we first started Luxury Holidays in 2023, we have constantly honed and polished our collection. Today, we offer holidays across the world, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, as far from the Far East to the Maldives. We spend time handpicking our destinations and selecting partners that we know can guarantee the service and high standards both we and our guests demand. We do not settle for anything less than the best. Luxury Holidays joined an amazing collection of brands when Travelopia took us under their wing in 2023. We look forward to sharing the next 50 years with you.
